                <p>Cristina is a talented designer who is extremely focused and dedicated to her work.
                    I’ve seen
                    her grow and evolve in her role exponentially. Cristina often took it upon herself to train herself
                    in
                    new
                    skills, and when she did, they grew the skillset of our team and proved to be invaluable additions.
                    Cristina
                    never leaves a job unfinished and continues until she has it "just right". In a world of chaining
                    priorities and
                    deadlines, Cristina always communicates timelines effectively and asks questions that make sure to
                    produce the
                    best results for the team.</p>

                <p>I have worked with Cristina since 2014 and she is an extremely valued member of the
                    team. She combines attention to detail and creativity to create a wide range of design work from
                    brochures to
                    exhibition stands, online dynamic MPUs and leaderboards, to newsletters, interactive PDFs and email
                    templates.
                    Cristina's eagerness to self-teach and constantly evolve has led to many great pieces of work being
                    able to be

                <p>I had the pleasure of working together with Cristina Calin on a number of projects,
                    which has been absolutely great! Cristina is very skilled, has eye for elegance, works really fast
                    and
                    reliably.

                <p>I worked closely with Cristina at Buck Consultants on a number of investment
                    publications and
                    she was a pleasure to work with. She was always able to produce high quality work, often under
                    difficult
                    time
                    constraints and could always be relied upon to exceed expectations. Cristina always came across as
                    highly
                    motivated and someone who was striving to achieve the best results, taking great pride in her work.
